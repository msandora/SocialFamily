The following worked for me, and the order of commands is important. 
1. npm install firebase --save
2. npm install firebase-admin --save
you might have to `sudo` these commands depending on how you are logged-in and re-instantiating firebase like this will work as a charm!

Anyone else getting CORS policy error whenever they use axios to call the firebase API? I'm working on a fix but I'm wondering if others have the same issue.
EDIT: Here is my fix:
Make sure your command line is in the firebase functions folder. Run 'npm i cors --savedev'
Then in index.js of the functions folder at the top add 'const cors = require('cors');
Then add the line app.use(cors());
And your done!

firebase serve --port 4000
